# timecard-kt
timecard-kt is a command line time tracker written in Kotlin.
Easily clock in & out and check how much time you've worked and how long you've been on break.
Quite configurable within the app itself, from 24-hour time to formatting how time is displayed.

## Getting Started
1. See installation instructions in [releases](https://github.com/Stephen-Hamilton-C/timecard-kt/releases/latest)
2. Open a terminal and run `timecard-kt in` to clock in, `timecard-kt out` to clock out, and simply `timecard-kt` to see how many hours you've worked.
